# ML-poc

A set of Machine Learning proofs of concept for building various models useful in: 

## ML parser for chat
1. Using linear descriminant analysis (LDA) to find topical clusters in a high volume 
chatroom (aka Critical Role).

2. Experiments with _ensemble techniques_ to produce higher accuracy classifications
using ensemble techniques with Random Forest, and XGBoost.

```
./chat-classifier/lda
./chat-classifier/ensemble
```
3. A classifier that tries to do this with xml tags from a _large data store_, i.e. 
the US Patent Database.. 

## Cloud security detection.
## Data pipeline automation.
## Detection of outliers in Real Estate data.
## Jupyter notebook models for learning and practise.
## Other practise exercises.
